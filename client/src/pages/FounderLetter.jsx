        Founder&apos;s Letter â€“ From the Heart of Bhavana Matrimony
      </h1>

      <p className="mb-4">Dear Member,</p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Warm greetings to you.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        I am <strong>Bhavana Madhav</strong>, the founder of <strong>Bhavana Matrimony</strong>.
        I welcome you to a platform that is not just about finding a life partner â€” but about building
        meaningful, lasting relationships rooted in values, culture, and trust.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        At Bhavana Matrimony, we believe that <strong>marriage is more than a union of two individuals</strong> â€” 
        it is the coming together of two families, two traditions, and two hearts. In todayâ€™s fast-paced digital age, 
        where depth in relationships is often overlooked, our mission is to restore the essence of <strong>commitment, 
        understanding, and emotional bonding</strong> in matrimonial connections.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">ðŸ”¹ Our Purpose:</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>To guide todayâ€™s youth toward meaningful, responsible relationships</li>
        <li>To provide a <strong>safe, transparent, and accessible</strong> matrimonial platform for every community</li>
        <li>To combine <strong>technology with tradition</strong>, offering online tools along with offline support like horoscope matching, personalized suggestions, and relationship counseling</li>
        <li>To promote <strong>equality, harmony, and long-term compatibility</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mt-4">
        We understand that the younger generation seeks more than just a profile â€” they seek <strong>understanding, respect, and true companionship</strong>. Bhavana Matrimony is designed to deliver just that, with empathy at its core.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">ðŸ’  Our Social Commitment:</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Bhavana Matrimony is not just a business â€” it is a <strong>social movement</strong> that stands for:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Promoting dowry-free marriages</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Supporting economically and socially weaker sections</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Conducting awareness drives, premarital counseling, and community engagement</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mt-4">
        We invite you to be a part of this journey â€” a journey where marriages are not just arranged, but nurtured; 
        where matches are not just made, but guided by values and trust.
